# Contributing to Meatify ü•©

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Meatify as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Docker (for testing containerized deployment)
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/meatify.git
cd meatify

# 3. Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/meatify.git

# 4. Install dependencies
npm install

# 5. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing new feature"
   ```

3. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-new-feature
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch

### Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(sensors): add support for 8th temperature probe"
git commit -m "fix(mobile): resolve chart rendering issue on iOS Safari"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update deployment instructions"
```

## üß™ Testing Your Changes

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test Docker build
docker build -t meatify-test .
docker run -p 3000:3000 meatify-test

# Test production build
npm run build
npm start
```

### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Lint your code
npm run lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Format code (if Prettier is configured)
npm run format
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Components**: Reusable React components in `/components`
- **Pages**: Next.js pages in `/app`
- **Utils**: Utility functions in `/lib`
- **Types**: TypeScript types in `/lib/types.ts`
- **API**: API routes in `/app/api`

### Coding Standards

#### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define proper interfaces for all data structures
- Avoid `any` types - use proper typing
- Export types for reuse across components

#### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper props interfaces
- Use meaningful component and prop names
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

#### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use semantic class names
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography

#### Performance
- Optimize for mobile devices
- Minimize API calls and data fetching
- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states

### Sensor Data Integration
When working with temperature sensor data:
- Always validate incoming sensor data
- Handle sensor disconnection gracefully  
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Consider data persistence and session management

## üéØ Areas We Need Help With

- **Hardware Integration**: Support for additional sensor types
- **Mobile Optimization**: iOS/Android specific improvements
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
- **Data Export**: CSV/JSON export functionality
- **Charts & Analytics**: Advanced temperature analysis features
- **Documentation**: User guides and API documentation
- **Testing**: Unit tests and integration tests

## üìö Resources

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [Chart.js Documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/)
- [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
